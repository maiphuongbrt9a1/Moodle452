# Moodle Auth One-Time Password Authentication plugin

OTP plugin validates the user using the phone number and one-time password that send in their validated phone number. No users need to remember the password or any other credentials. There is no trouble registering a user. The new users are automatically registered by the system. Multiple OTP service supported Like AWS sns service, TwilioTwilio sms service etc

Additional security can be set:

revoke threshold: login failures limit causing revoke of the generated password, works independently of the account lockout (lockout threshold and lockout window site security settings)

minimum request period: a time in seconds after which another password can be generated


Auth instruction setting (global auth_instructions) is recommended depending on the adopted user account policy and plugin configuration.
